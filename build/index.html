      Here's a general overview of how such an application could be built:
      
      The application's front-end is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to build reusable UI components that can be easily managed and updated in response to changes in the application's state.
      
      A real-time communication feature is implemented using a library such as Socket.IO. This library allows the client and server to establish a real-time connection and exchange messages in real-time.
      
      The application's back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, while Express.js is a web framework for Node.js that allows you to easily handle HTTP requests and responses.
      
      The back-end is responsible for handling the real-time communication between clients by using Socket.IO. When a client sends a message, the server broadcast it to all connected clients.
      
      The application's state is managed using a library such as Redux, which allows you to manage the state of your application in a centralized store. This makes it easy to update the UI in response to changes in the application's state, such as new messages being received.
      
      The application's data is stored in a database such as MongoDB or Firebase. This allows the application to persist data and retrieve it later, even after the user has closed the application.
      
      The application is hosted on a platform such as Heroku or Now."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo_new.webp"/><link rel="manifest" href="logo_new.webp"/><title>Realtime chat App</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.11fec442.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.4a78a364.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
